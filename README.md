Safari 4 had as shortlived JavaScript API called WebSQL.

It was just bindings to an SQLite database which that had similar
limitations to cookies: one db per domain.

This was a little app that would download your delicious bookmarks and
query them offline and hence lightning fast.

It no longer works because WebSQL has been removed in Safari 5.
