## Overdrive

Safari 4 had a shortlived JavaScript API called WebSQL. 
It was just bindings to an SQLite database that had similar
limitations to cookies: one db per domain.

Overdrive was a little app that would download your delicious bookmarks and
query them offline and hence lightning fast.

It no longer works because WebSQL has been removed in Safari 5.
